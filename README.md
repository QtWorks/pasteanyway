# pasteanyway
This is a Qt Application, that allows you to "paste" ascii text into forms/websites/apps that are trying to block you from pasting (for whatever reason). You paste your text into the program, then click the button, and within 5 seconds click the form that you want it to paste into. The program will type the characters needed to replicate a paste!

Linux needs "apt-get install libxtst-dev" for the extra header files; Windows should just work.
